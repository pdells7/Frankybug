    <li>A Little Bit About:"Frank The Bug"</li>
    <p>
      Our subject Frank is known for being a savy tech guy. He loves to airdrop all kinds of things, whether it be an image or a piece of pizza. Frank is an airdrop dignitary.
      He uses an app called "smart news" as a source of his brilliance. One of his favorite human beings is a young gentleman who goes by the name of Tucker Carlson. Tucker is a fair and balanced man. Fair and balanced is Franks "M.O.".
